# Text-Based Adventure Game in Rust

This is a simple text-based adventure game built with Rust, using the `rustyline` crate for user input. Players can explore rooms, view descriptions, and move around in different directions. The game includes a few rooms, each with its own description and exits, allowing for basic exploration.

## Features
- **Multiple Rooms:** Each room has a unique description and exits to other rooms.
- **Player Commands:** Players can enter commands to navigate or look around.
- **Basic Navigation:** Players can move between rooms by entering directions (e.g., `go north`).

## How to Play

Once you start the game, you can use the following commands:

- **look** - Displays the current room's description and available exits.
- **go <direction>** - Move to a different room in the specified direction. Available directions are `north`, `south`, `east`, and `west`.
- **quit** - Exits the game.

### Example Commands
```plaintext
>> look
>> go north
>> quit
```

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/t9fiction/Rust-pathfinder-game.git
   cd adventure-game
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Rust installed. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

3. **Build and Run the Game:**
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Code Overview

- **Room** - Represents a room in the game with a description and exits.
- **Player** - Tracks the player’s current location.
- **Game** - Manages the game state, including the rooms and the player.

## Dependencies

This game uses the following Rust crate:

- [`rustyline`](https://docs.rs/rustyline/) - A readline library for handling user input in a command-line environment.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for extending the game:

- **More Rooms and Puzzles:** Add more rooms and interactive puzzles.
- **Inventory System:** Allow players to collect and use items.
- **Enhanced Commands:** Add more player commands, such as `take`, `use`, and `inspect`.
